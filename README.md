# Sonic Surgeon

[Play here ](/TremorTable)
**Educational minigame showcasing non invasive neurosurgery for movement disorders.**

Plan and perform MRgFUS vim thalamotomy* for essential tremor.
* Bilaterally; creative license allowed.

Suitable for outreach events where players get 1-2 turns max (there are no difficulty levels; and the game is very easy to beat!)
Play on web alone, but best paired with the [tremor table](/TremorTable) for an integrated functional neurosurgical experience.

## Description
We've built this to take to the Royal Sciety Summer Science Exhibition 2025; as part of one the main exhibits; 'Focused Ultrasound- Extraordinary Energy'
<a  href="https://tom-gilbertsons-lab.github.io/the_thalamotomist/"  target="_blank">Play Online</a>; also
But much better to pair with a wobbling table as cotrolled via studd.
